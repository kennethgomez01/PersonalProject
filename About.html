		<!-- My Personal BIO -->
		<p class="paraFont">I have choose to make this as my project for Computer/Science as I do really like animals since I was young, I do remembered, when my first time to see home snake, love birds, parrots, turtle, bat and more. It is so fascinating to see them in the safe distance. This website will educate the viewers about wild creatures with its own definition that could connect them to the reality by learning how to avoid this creatures, and to learn the evolvement of this creatures since the Dinosaur age.</p>
