			<p class="parafont">Reaching 10 feet in length and more than 300 pounds, Komodo dragons are the heaviest lizards on Earth. 
			They have long, flat heads with rounded snouts, scaly skin, bowed legs, and huge, muscular tails.
			<br><br>The dragon has venom glands, which are loaded with toxins that lower blood pressure, cause massive bleeding, prevent clotting, and induce shock. 
			They bite down with serrated teeth and pull back with powerful neck muscles. 
			The result: huge gaping wounds. The venom then quickens the loss of blood and sends the prey into shock. 
			Animals that escape the jaws of a Komodo will only feel lucky briefly. 
			Dragons can calmly follow an escapee for miles as the venom takes effect, using their keen sense of smell to hone in on the corpse. 
			A dragon can eat a whopping 80 percent of its body weight in a single feeding.
			<br><br>There is a stable population of Komodo dragons on the islands of Komodo, Gila Motang, Rinca, and Flores. 
			However, a dearth of egg-laying females, poaching, human encroachment, and natural disasters have threaten the species' population.</p><br>
			
			<h2 class="subhead">Special Interactions of this Creature</h2><br>
			
			<p class="parafont">As the dominant predators on the handful of islands they inhabit, they will eat almost anything, 
			including carrion, deer, pigs, smaller dragons, and even large water buffalo and humans. 
			When hunting, Komodo dragons rely on camouflage and patience, lying in wait for passing prey. When a victim ambles by, 
			the dragon springs, using its powerful legs, sharp claws and serrated, shark-like teeth to eviscerate its prey.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br>

			<p class="parafont">The large northern fur seal, found in chilly northern waters, was hunted to near extinction during the 19th century. 
			These animals were protected by law in 1911, and populations later rebounded to 1.3 million animals.
			<br><br><br>There are eight species of southern fur seals, all smaller than their northern relative. 
			They include the Guadalupe fur seal of Baja California, the brown fur seal of southern Africa and Australia, and the South American fur seal.

			<p class="parafont">When breeding season arrives, however, these social animals gather on shore in very large numbers. 
			Powerful males, known as bulls, establish territories and gather harems of up to 40 females, battling their rivals to establish dominance. 
			During this season, coastlines are filled with roaring, growling, honking seals.
			<br><br><br>Female fur seals, or cows, give birth during this breeding season, then mate again just a few days later. 
			The following year they will return to give birth to a single pup after a nearly yearlong pregnancy, and mate once again to continue the cycle.
			<br><br><br>Many fur seal populations have not rebounded from extensive hunting, and now face additional threats from climate change and overfishing, which can limit their prey.</p><br>
			
			<h2 class="subhead">Special Interactions of this Creature</h2><br>
			
			<p class="parafont">Fur seals have sharp eyesight and keen hearing. They have small ears, unlike the earless or hair seals.
			<br><br><br>Although they breathe air, seals are most at home in the water and may stay at sea for weeks at a time eating fish, squid, birds, and tiny shrimp-like krill. 
			Fur seals may swim by themselves or gather in small groups.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br>

			<p class="parafont">The American alligator is a rare success story of an endangered animal not only saved from extinction but now thriving. 
			State and federal protections, habitat preservation efforts, 
			and reduced demand for alligator products have improved the species' wild population to more than one million and growing today.</p><br><br><br><br>

			<p class="parafont">One look at these menacing predators with their armored, 
			lizard-like bodies, muscular tails, and powerful jaws and it is obvious they are envoys from the distant past. 
			The species, scientists say, is more than 150 million years old, 
			managing to avoid extinction 65 million years ago when their prehistoric contemporaries, the dinosaurs, died off.
			<br><br><br>American alligators reside nearly exclusively in the freshwater rivers, lakes, swamps, 
			and marshes of the southeastern United States, primarily Florida and Louisiana.
			Heavy and ungainly out of water, these reptiles are supremely well adapted swimmers. 
			Males average 10 to 15 feet in length and can weigh 1,000 pounds. Females grow to a maximum of about 9.8 feet.
			<br><br><br>Hatchlings are 6 to 8 inches long with yellow and black stripes. 
			Juveniles, which are on the menu for dozens of predators, including birds, raccoons, bobcats, 
			and even other alligators, usually stay with their mothers for about two years.
			<br><br><br>Adult alligators are apex predators critical to the biodiversity of their habitat. 
			They feed mainly on fish, turtles, snakes, and small mammals. However, they are opportunists, 
			and a hungry gator will eat just about anything, including carrion, pets and, in rare instances, humans.</p><br>
			
			<h2 class="subhead">Special Interactions of this Creature</h2><br>
			
			<p class="parafont">The female opens the nest in response to calls from the hatchlings when the eggs are ready to hatch. 
			She carries 8 to 10 hatchlings at a time in her mouth down to the water, pulling her tongue down to make a pouch in which they sit. 
			Upon arrival in the water, she opens her jaws and shakes her head gently from side to side, encouraging the hatchlings to swim out. 
			<br><br><br>The juveniles aggregate in pods that may include hatchlings from other nests and remain close to the mother typically as long as one year, but sometimes for two or even three years. 
			This social system affords protection during their most vulnerable life stage from predators such as raccoons, 
			large fish, birds, and even other alligators mostly large, dominant males. 
			The females respond swiftly to calls from hatchlings facing impending danger. 
			Hatchlings grow rapidly, especially during their first four years, sometimes averaging more than 1 foot of growth for each year of life.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br>

			<h2 class="danger">Danger to Human</h2>
			<p class="parafont">American alligators are one of these aggressive species. 
			However, the IUCN also says that only 6% of American alligator attacks are fatal. 
			That is a low risk of death, particularly when compared to 63% for the ferocious Nile crocodile and 25-50% for the saltwater crocodile.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
