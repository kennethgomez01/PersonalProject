			<h2 class="subhead">Unique of this Creature:</h2><br>
			
			<p class="parafont">Reaching 10 feet in length and more than 300 pounds, Komodo dragons are the heaviest lizards on Earth. 
			They have long, flat heads with rounded snouts, scaly skin, bowed legs, and huge, muscular tails.
			<br><br>The dragon has venom glands, which are loaded with toxins that lower blood pressure, cause massive bleeding, prevent clotting, and induce shock. 
			They bite down with serrated teeth and pull back with powerful neck muscles. 
			The result: huge gaping wounds. The venom then quickens the loss of blood and sends the prey into shock. 
			Animals that escape the jaws of a Komodo will only feel lucky briefly. 
			Dragons can calmly follow an escapee for miles as the venom takes effect, using their keen sense of smell to hone in on the corpse. 
			A dragon can eat a whopping 80 percent of its body weight in a single feeding.
			<br><br>There is a stable population of Komodo dragons on the islands of Komodo, Gila Motang, Rinca, and Flores. 
			However, a dearth of egg-laying females, poaching, human encroachment, and natural disasters have threaten the species' population.</p><br>
			
			
			<h2 class="subhead">Special Interactions of this Creature</h2><br>
			
			<p class="parafont">As the dominant predators on the handful of islands they inhabit, they will eat almost anything, 
			including carrion, deer, pigs, smaller dragons, and even large water buffalo and humans. 
			When hunting, Komodo dragons rely on camouflage and patience, lying in wait for passing prey. When a victim ambles by, 
			the dragon springs, using its powerful legs, sharp claws and serrated, shark-like teeth to eviscerate its prey.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br>

			<h2>Common Name: <em>Fur Seals</em></h2>
			<h2>Scientific Name: <em>Arctocephalinae</em></h2>

			<h2>Diet: <em>Carnivore</em></h2>
			<h2>Average Life span in the wild: <em>12 to 30 years</em></h2>

			<p class="parafont">The large northern fur seal, found in chilly northern waters, was hunted to near extinction during the 19th century. 
			These animals were protected by law in 1911, and populations later rebounded to 1.3 million animals.</p><br><br><br><br>
		
		
		<!-- Unique -->
			
			<h2 class="subhead">Unique of this Creature:</h2><br>
			
			<p class="parafont">There are eight species of southern fur seals, all smaller than their northern relative. 
			They include the Guadalupe fur seal of Baja California, the brown fur seal of southern Africa and Australia, and the South American fur seal.
			<br><br>When breeding season arrives, however, these social animals gather on shore in very large numbers. Powerful males, known as bulls, 
			establish territories and gather harems of up to 40 females, battling their rivals to establish dominance. 
			During this season, coastlines are filled with roaring, growling, honking seals.
			<br><br>Female fur seals, or cows, give birth during this breeding season, then mate again just a few days later. 
			The following year they will return to give birth to a single pup after a nearly yearlong pregnancy, and mate once again to continue the cycle.
			<br><br>Many fur seal populations have not rebounded from extensive hunting, and now face additional threats from climate change and overfishing, which can limit their prey.</p><br>

			<h2 class="danger">Danger to Human</h2>
			<p class="parafont">Seals may become ill from the food or may become dependant on humans for food. 
			Seals are wild animals that can be aggressive and bite, causing major wounds and possibly infections to humans.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
