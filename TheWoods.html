			<h2 class="subhead">Type of Species</h2><br>
			
			<p class="parafont">Once widespread throughout the forests of Asia, orangutans are now found on just two islands, Sumatra and Borneo. 
			<br> There are three genetically distinct species: the Sumatran orangutan (Pongo abelii), 
			the Tapanuli orangutan (Pongo tapanuliensis), and the Bornean orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus). 
			The three species look slightly different: Sumatran orangutans have lighter hair and a longer beard than their Bornean relatives,
			and Sumatran males have narrower cheekpads. 
			Tapanuli orangutans have smaller heads. 
			All species are highly endangered due to habitat loss and poaching. 
			100 years ago there were thought to be 315,000 orangutans in the wild. 
			There are now less than 14,600 left in Sumatra, and less than 54,000 in Borneo. 
			There are only 800 Tapanuli orangutans left, making them the most endangered Great Ape species in the world. 
			They were only identified as a distinct species in 2017 and live in an area of forest known as Batang Toru, 
			which is currently under threat as the site of a proposed hydro-electric dam. 
			It is thought that they may be the first Great Apes to become extinct unless we help to protect them.</p>

			<p class="parafont">Orangutans also differ from the other Great Apes in that they do not live in family groups. 
			The largest family unit is a female and two offspring, and males and females usually meet up only to breed. 
			<br> Orangutans are highly intelligent and gentle animals. 
			They use tools in the wild and have excellent memories, making mental maps of their forest home in order to find fruiting trees throughout the seasons.</p><br><br>

			<h2 class="subhead">Special Interactions of this Creature</h2><br>
			
			<p class="parafont">Males who are not yet fully mature tend to associate with other females, 
			particularly adolescent females, but are not usually aggressive. Flanged adult male orangutans are the most solitary of all orangutans. 
			Their participation in social groups is usually limited to temporary sexual encounters with receptive females. 
			<br> This semi-solitary social system may have evolved as a result of a ripe fruit diet, scattered food distribution, and the unpredictability of available food. 
			Orangutans spend up to 60% of their time foraging and eating.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br>

		<p class="parafont">The giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), 
		also known as the ant bear, is a large insectivorous mammal native to Central and South America. 
		It is one of four living species of anteaters, the only extant member of the genus Myrmecophaga, 
		and is classified with sloths in the order Pilosa.</p>

		<p class="parafont">Anteaters are edentate animals—they have no teeth. But their long tongues are more than sufficient to lap up the 35,000 ants and termites they swallow whole each day. 
		The giant anteater can reach 7 feet long from the tip of its snout to the end of its tail.
		The anteater uses its sharp claws to tear an opening into an anthill and put its long snout and efficient tongue to work. 
		But it has to eat quickly, flicking its tongue up to 160 times per minute. 
		Ants fight back with painful stings, so an anteater may spend only a minute feasting on each mound. Anteaters never destroy a nest, preferring to return and feed again in the future.
        These animals find their quarry not by sight—theirs is poor—but by smell.

		<!-- Interactions -->
		
		<h2 class="subhead">Special Interactions of this Creature</h2><br>
			
		<p class="parafont">The main organisms that giant anteaters have interactions with are, 
		obviously, ants and termites. This is a predatory relationship, with the anteaters being the predators and the ants being the prey.
		Another predatory interaction the anteater has is with the jaguars and closely related pumas, 
		only this time, the giant anteater is the prey and the jaguars and pumas are the predators.</p><br><br>
		
		
		<h2 class="danger">Danger to Human</h2>
		<p class="parafont">Even this Creature doesn't have any teeth it is good idea to be in the safe distance and to not pet it as it is still wild animal.
		According to the source scientists detail a gruesome anteater attack that left one hunter dead in northwestern Brazil, 
		just two years after another man was killed in a similar confrontation with one of the long-nosed creatures. </p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

				<h2>Common Name: <em>Black Bear</em></h2>

			<!--  Type of Species -->
			
			<h2 class="subhead">Type of Species</h2><br>
			
			<p class="parafont">Although the Black Bear is still widespread throughout much of North America today, 
			their historical range once covered the entire continent where they would have been found in every inhabitable patch of forest. 
			Today they are found from northern Canada, throughout western and parts of eastern USA, and down into northern Mexico. 
			Providing there is a forest habitat of some description these incredibly adaptable animals will try their best to survive successfully there and they are actually found in a number of very diverse regions. 
			Black Bears are known to inhabit the hot and dry, 
			shrubby forests of Mexico and the steamy, 
			hardwood swamps of the south-eastern USA, 
			right up to the coniferous forests of Canada and Alaska and the barren treeless tundra even further north. 
			Despite local populations in some areas being affected by loss of their natural habitats, 
			the resilience of the Black Bear means that populations in most areas are actually increasing.</p>
			
			
			<!-- Unique -->
			
			<h2 class="subhead">Unique of this Creature:</h2><br>
			
			<p class="parafont">The Black Bear is a largely solitary and nocturnal hunter, 
			that may occasionally tolerate the presence of other individuals when a number gather around an ample food source. 
			Black Bears spend the majority of their waking life searching for food in the surrounding forest and must eat vast quantities of plant matter every day to ensure that they build up a decent fat reserve for the coming winter. 
			When the hostile winter conditions set in, 
			Black Bears retreat into a den under a hollow tree or in a burrow, 
			where they semi-hibernate through the cold months ahead. 
			Although this is not true hibernation as their body temperature only drops minimally, 
			it means that they are able to wake up and venture out in search of a light snack to break up their long slumber. 
			In hotter regions in the south Black Bears may not bother denning over the winter at all (with the exception of pregnant females), 
			but in the most northerly parts of their range they may not emerge until 8 months later.</p><br><br>
			
			
			<h2 class="subhead">Special Interactions of this Creature</h2><br>
			
			<p class="parafont">When a black bear is threatened he usually runs from the perceived threat or goes up a tree. 
			With cubs out of danger, female black bears don't have to make vigorous defences that risk potential injury. 
			Although black bears tend to retreat from people, they are still incredibly strong animals that can cause injuries.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br>
