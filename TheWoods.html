			<h2 class="subhead">Type of Species</h2><br>
			
			<p class="parafont">Once widespread throughout the forests of Asia, orangutans are now found on just two islands, Sumatra and Borneo. 
			<br> There are three genetically distinct species: the Sumatran orangutan (Pongo abelii), 
			the Tapanuli orangutan (Pongo tapanuliensis), and the Bornean orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus). 
			The three species look slightly different: Sumatran orangutans have lighter hair and a longer beard than their Bornean relatives,
			and Sumatran males have narrower cheekpads. 
			Tapanuli orangutans have smaller heads. 
			All species are highly endangered due to habitat loss and poaching. 
			100 years ago there were thought to be 315,000 orangutans in the wild. 
			There are now less than 14,600 left in Sumatra, and less than 54,000 in Borneo. 
			There are only 800 Tapanuli orangutans left, making them the most endangered Great Ape species in the world. 
			They were only identified as a distinct species in 2017 and live in an area of forest known as Batang Toru, 
			which is currently under threat as the site of a proposed hydro-electric dam. 
			It is thought that they may be the first Great Apes to become extinct unless we help to protect them.</p>

			<h2 class="subhead">Unique of this Creature:</h2><br>
			
			<p class="parafont">The Malay word orangutan means “person of the forest.” These long-haired, orangish primates, found only in Sumatra and Borneo, 
			are highly intelligent and are close relatives of humans.
			<br><br>Orangutans have an enormous arm span. A male may stretch his arms some 7 feet from fingertip to fingertip—a reach considerably longer than his standing height of about 5 feet. 
			When orangutans do stand, their hands nearly touch the ground.
			<br><br>Orangutans' arms are well suited to their lifestyle because they spend much of their time (some 90 percent) in the trees of their tropical rain forest home. 
			They even sleep aloft in nests of leafy branches. They use large leaves as umbrellas and shelters to protect themselves from the common rains.
			<br><br>These cerebral primates forage for food during daylight hours. Most of their diet consists of fruit and leaves gathered from rain forest trees. They also eat bark, insects and, on rare occasions, meat.
			<br><br>Orangutans are more solitary than other apes. Males are loners. As they move through the forest they make plenty of rumbling, howling calls to ensure that they stay out of each other's way. The “long call” can be heard 1.2 miles away.
			<br><br>Mothers and their young, however, share a strong bond. Infants will stay with their mothers for some six or seven years until they develop the skills to survive on their own. 
			Female orangutans give birth only once every eight years—the longest time period of any animal. The animals are long-lived and have survived as long as 60 years in captivity.
			<br><br>Because orangutans live in only a few places, and because they are so dependent upon trees, they are particularly susceptible to logging in these areas. Unfortunately, deforestation and other human activities, such as hunting, have placed the orangutan in danger of extinction.</p><br><br>

			<h2 class="subhead">Special Interactions of this Creature</h2><br>
			
			<p class="parafont">Males who are not yet fully mature tend to associate with other females, 
			particularly adolescent females, but are not usually aggressive. Flanged adult male orangutans are the most solitary of all orangutans. 
			Their participation in social groups is usually limited to temporary sexual encounters with receptive females. 
			<br> This semi-solitary social system may have evolved as a result of a ripe fruit diet, scattered food distribution, and the unpredictability of available food. 
			Orangutans spend up to 60% of their time foraging and eating.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br>
			
			
			<!-- Danger -->
		
			<h2 class="danger">Danger to Human</h2>
			<p class="parafont">According to the source Orangutan tend to attack to human in some occasions
			were they feel threaten or they have been disturb in their natural habitat. Like Humans Orangutan known to be aggressive and they could kill human by their weight and strengths.
			But Orangutan is not just Danger to human, as their population started to drop because of human killings.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

			<h2>Common Name: <em>Anteater</em></h2>

		<p class="parafont">The giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla), 
		also known as the ant bear, is a large insectivorous mammal native to Central and South America. 
		It is one of four living species of anteaters, the only extant member of the genus Myrmecophaga, 
		and is classified with sloths in the order Pilosa.</p>

		<h2 class="subhead">Unique of this Creature:</h2><br>
			
		<p class="parafont">Anteaters are edentate animals—they have no teeth. But their long tongues are more than sufficient to lap up the 35,000 ants and termites they swallow whole each day. 
		The giant anteater can reach 7 feet long from the tip of its snout to the end of its tail.
		The anteater uses its sharp claws to tear an opening into an anthill and put its long snout and efficient tongue to work. 
		But it has to eat quickly, flicking its tongue up to 160 times per minute. 
		Ants fight back with painful stings, so an anteater may spend only a minute feasting on each mound. Anteaters never destroy a nest, preferring to return and feed again in the future.
        These animals find their quarry not by sight—theirs is poor—but by smell.

		<!-- Interactions -->
		
		<h2 class="subhead">Special Interactions of this Creature</h2><br>
			
		<p class="parafont">The main organisms that giant anteaters have interactions with are, 
		obviously, ants and termites. This is a predatory relationship, with the anteaters being the predators and the ants being the prey.
		Another predatory interaction the anteater has is with the jaguars and closely related pumas, 
		only this time, the giant anteater is the prey and the jaguars and pumas are the predators.</p><br><br>

		<h2 class="danger">Danger to Human</h2>
		<p class="parafont">Even this Creature doesn't have any teeth it is good idea to be in the safe distance and to not pet it as it is still wild animal.
		According to the source scientists detail a gruesome anteater attack that left one hunter dead in northwestern Brazil, 
		just two years after another man was killed in a similar confrontation with one of the long-nosed creatures. </p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

			<h2 class="subhead">Type of Species</h2><br>
			
			<p class="parafont">Black bears are North America's most familiar and common bears. 
			They typically live in forests and are excellent tree climbers, but are also found in mountains and swamps. 
			Despite their name, black bears can be blue-gray or blue-black, brown, cinnamon, or even (very rarely) white.</p>
			
			
			<!-- Unique -->
			
			<h2 class="subhead">Unique of this Creature:</h2><br>
			
			<p class="parafont">Black bears are very opportunistic eaters. Most of their diet consists of grasses, roots, berries, and insects. 
			They will also eat fish and mammals—including carrion—and easily develop a taste for human foods and garbage. 
			Bears who become habituated to human food at campsites, cabins, or rural homes can become dangerous and are often killed—thus the frequent reminder: Please don't feed the bears!
			<br><br>Solitary animals, black bears roam large territories, though they do not protect them from other bears. Males might wander a 15- to 80-square-mile home range.
			<br><br>When winter arrives, black bears spend the season dormant in their dens, feeding on body fat they have built up by eating ravenously all summer and fall. 
			They make their dens in caves, burrows, brush piles, or other sheltered spots—sometimes even in tree holes high above the ground. 
			Black bears den for various lengths of time governed by the diverse climates in which they live, from Canada to northern Mexico.
			<br><br>Female black bears give birth to two or three blind, helpless cubs in mid-winter and nurse them in the den until spring, 
			when all emerge in search of food. The cubs will stay with their very protective mother for about two years.</p><br><br>
			
			
			<h2 class="subhead">Special Interactions of this Creature</h2><br>
			
			<p class="parafont">When a black bear is threatened he usually runs from the perceived threat or goes up a tree. 
			With cubs out of danger, female black bears don't have to make vigorous defences that risk potential injury. 
			Although black bears tend to retreat from people, they are still incredibly strong animals that can cause injuries.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br>
			
			
			<!-- Danger -->
		
			<h2 class="danger">Danger to Human</h2>
			<p class="parafont">Black Bear is known to attack Humans specially does people who are in campings 
			and brought their food with them. According to the research most bears don't have any tensions to attact Humans, 
			that people mostly been attacked by Wild bear is when they get too close to the Bear territory or trying to get their babbies in most they will turn into massive mutant.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
