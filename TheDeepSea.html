			<p class="parafont">The giant squid remains largely a mystery to scientists despite being the biggest invertebrate on Earth. 
			The largest of these elusive giants ever found measured 59 feet in length and weighed nearly a ton.</p><br><br><br><br>

			<p class="parafont">However, their inhospitable deep-sea habitat has made them uniquely difficult to study, 
			and almost everything scientists know about them is from carcasses that have washed up on beaches or been hauled in by fishermen. 
			Lately, however, the fortunes of scientists studying these elusive creatures have begun to turn. 
			In 2004 researchers in Japan took the first images ever of a live giant squid. And in late 2006, 
			scientists with Japan's National Science Museum caught and brought to the surface a live 24-foot female giant squid.
			<br><br>Giant squid, along with their cousin, the colossal squid, 
			have the largest eyes in the animal kingdom, measuring some 10 inches in diameter. 
			These massive organs allow them to detect objects in the lightless depths where most other animals would see nothing.
			<br><br>Like other squid species, they have eight arms and two longer feeding tentacles that help them bring food to their beak-like mouths. 
			Their diet likely consists of fish, shrimp, and other squid, and some suggest they might even attack and eat small whales.
			They maneuver their massive bodies with fins that seem diminutive for their size. They use their funnel as a propulsion system, 
			drawing water into the mantle, or main part of the body, and forcing it out the back.
			Scientists don't know enough about these beasts to say for sure what their range is, 
			but giant squid carcasses have been found in all of the world's oceans.<br><br></p><br><br>

			<h2 class="danger">Danger to Human</h2>
			<p class="parafont">Giant Squid does not intend to attack human other than other fish, 
			but don't take this as welcome as this is not pet it will attack you if they feel threathened, 
			and most of Squids contains venom and ink that they spray when they feel threatened.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

		<!--  Type of Species -->
			
		<h2 class="subhead">Type of Species</h2><br><br><br><br>
			
		<p class="parafont">The anglerfish is a fish of the teleost order Lophiiformes. The angry-looking deep sea anglerfish has a right to be cranky. 
		It is quite possibly the ugliest animal on the planet, and it lives in what is easily Earth's most inhospitable habitat: the lonely, 
		lightless bottom of the sea..</p><br><br>
			
			
		<!-- Unique -->
			
		<h2 class="subhead">Unique of this Creature:</h2><br><br>
			
		<p class="parafont">There are more than 200 species of anglerfish, most of which live in the murky depths of the Atlantic and Antarctic oceans, 
		up to a mile below the surface, although some live in shallow, tropical environments. 
		Generally dark gray to dark brown in color, they have huge heads and enormous crescent-shaped mouths filled with sharp, 
		translucent teeth. Some angler fish can be quite large, reaching 3.3 feet in length. 
		Most however are significantly smaller, often less than a foot.
		<br>Their most distinctive feature, worn only by females, is a piece of dorsal spine that protrudes above their mouths like a fishing poleâ€”hence their name.
		Tipped with a lure of luminous flesh this built-in rod baits prey close enough to be snatched. 
		Their mouths are so big and their bodies so pliable, they can actually swallow prey up to twice their own size.</p><br><br>
			
			
		<!-- Interactions -->
		
		<h2 class="subhead">Special Interactions of this Creature</h2><br>
			
		<p class="parafont">The male, which is significantly smaller than the female, 
		has no need for such an adaptation. In lieu of continually seeking the vast abyss for a female, 
		it has evolved into a permanent parasitic mate. When a young, free-swimming male angler encounters a female, 
		he latches onto her with his sharp teeth. Over time, the male physically fuses with the female, 
		connecting to her skin and bloodstream and losing his eyes and all his internal organs except the testes. 
		A female will carry six or more males on her body.</p><br><br>
		
		
		<!-- Danger -->
		
		<h2 class="danger">Danger to Human</h2>
		<p class="parafont">It is a small creature, unless you are a fish attract to its bait light that are made of bacteria,
		then its dangerous. Being said please don't pet this as a normal fish to aquarium as some maybe poisonous!</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

			<h2 class="subhead">Type of Species</h2><br>
			
			<p class="parafont">Although the Black Bear is still widespread throughout much of North America today, 
			their historical range once covered the entire continent where they would have been found in every inhabitable patch of forest. 
			Today they are found from northern Canada, throughout western and parts of eastern USA, and down into northern Mexico. 
			Providing there is a forest habitat of some description these incredibly adaptable animals will try their best to survive successfully there and they are actually found in a number of very diverse regions. 
			Black Bears are known to inhabit the hot and dry, 
			shrubby forests of Mexico and the steamy, 
			hardwood swamps of the south-eastern USA, 
			right up to the coniferous forests of Canada and Alaska and the barren treeless tundra even further north. 
			Despite local populations in some areas being affected by loss of their natural habitats, 
			the resilience of the Black Bear means that populations in most areas are actually increasing.</p><br><br><br><br>

			<p class="parafont">The Black Bear is a largely solitary and nocturnal hunter, 
			that may occasionally tolerate the presence of other individuals when a number gather around an ample food source. 
			Black Bears spend the majority of their waking life searching for food in the surrounding forest and must eat vast quantities of plant matter every day to ensure that they build up a decent fat reserve for the coming winter. 
			When the hostile winter conditions set in, 
			Black Bears retreat into a den under a hollow tree or in a burrow, 
			where they semi-hibernate through the cold months ahead. 
			Although this is not true hibernation as their body temperature only drops minimally, 
			it means that they are able to wake up and venture out in search of a light snack to break up their long slumber. 
			In hotter regions in the south Black Bears may not bother denning over the winter at all (with the exception of pregnant females), 
			but in the most northerly parts of their range they may not emerge until 8 months later.</p><br><br>
			
			
			<h2 class="subhead">Special Interactions of this Creature</h2><br>
			
			<p class="parafont">When a black bear is threatened he usually runs from the perceived threat or goes up a tree. 
			With cubs out of danger, female black bears don't have to make vigorous defences that risk potential injury. 
			Although black bears tend to retreat from people, they are still incredibly strong animals that can cause injuries.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br>
