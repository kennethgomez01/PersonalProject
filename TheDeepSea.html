			<p class="parafont">The giant squid remains largely a mystery to scientists despite being the biggest invertebrate on Earth. 
			The largest of these elusive giants ever found measured 59 feet in length and weighed nearly a ton.</p><br><br><br><br>
			
			<!-- Unique -->
			
			<h2 class="subhead">Unique of this Creature:</h2><br>
			
			<p class="parafont">However, their inhospitable deep-sea habitat has made them uniquely difficult to study, 
			and almost everything scientists know about them is from carcasses that have washed up on beaches or been hauled in by fishermen. 
			Lately, however, the fortunes of scientists studying these elusive creatures have begun to turn. 
			In 2004 researchers in Japan took the first images ever of a live giant squid. And in late 2006, 
			scientists with Japan's National Science Museum caught and brought to the surface a live 24-foot female giant squid.
			<br><br><br>Giant squid, along with their cousin, the colossal squid, 
			have the largest eyes in the animal kingdom, measuring some 10 inches in diameter. 
			These massive organs allow them to detect objects in the lightless depths where most other animals would see nothing.
			<br><br><br>Like other squid species, they have eight arms and two longer feeding tentacles that help them bring food to their beak-like mouths. 
			Their diet likely consists of fish, shrimp, and other squid, and some suggest they might even attack and eat small whales.
			They maneuver their massive bodies with fins that seem diminutive for their size. They use their funnel as a propulsion system, 
			drawing water into the mantle, or main part of the body, and forcing it out the back.
			Scientists don't know enough about these beasts to say for sure what their range is, 
			but giant squid carcasses have been found in all of the world's oceans.<br><br></p><br><br>

			<p class="parafont">Giant Squid does not intend to attack human other than other fish, 
			but don't take this as welcome as this is not pet it will attack you if they feel threathened, 
			and most of Squids contains venom and ink that they spray when they feel threatened.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

			<p class="parafont">The anglerfish is a fish of the teleost order Lophiiformes. The angry-looking deep sea anglerfish has a right to be cranky. 
			It is quite possibly the ugliest animal on the planet, and it lives in what is easily Earth's most inhospitable habitat: the lonely, 
			lightless bottom of the sea..</p><br><br>
			
			<!-- Unique -->
			
			<h2 class="subhead">Unique of this Creature:</h2><br><br>
			
			<p class="parafont">There are more than 200 species of anglerfish, most of which live in the murky depths of the Atlantic and Antarctic oceans, 
			up to a mile below the surface, although some live in shallow, tropical environments. 
			Generally dark gray to dark brown in color, they have huge heads and enormous crescent-shaped mouths filled with sharp, 
			translucent teeth. Some angler fish can be quite large, reaching 3.3 feet in length. 
			Most however are significantly smaller, often less than a foot.
			<br><br><br>Their most distinctive feature, worn only by females, is a piece of dorsal spine that protrudes above their mouths like a fishing poleâ€”hence their name.
			Tipped with a lure of luminous flesh this built-in rod baits prey close enough to be snatched. 
			Their mouths are so big and their bodies so pliable, they can actually swallow prey up to twice their own size.</p><br><br>
			
			<!-- Interactions -->
		
			<h2 class="subhead">Special Interactions of this Creature</h2><br>
			
			<p class="parafont">The male, which is significantly smaller than the female, 
			has no need for such an adaptation. In lieu of continually seeking the vast abyss for a female, 
			it has evolved into a permanent parasitic mate. When a young, free-swimming male angler encounters a female, 
			he latches onto her with his sharp teeth. Over time, the male physically fuses with the female, 
			connecting to her skin and bloodstream and losing his eyes and all his internal organs except the testes. 
			A female will carry six or more males on her body.</p><br><br>
		
			<!-- Danger -->
		
			<h2 class="danger">Danger to Human</h2>
			<p class="parafont">It is a small creature, unless you are a fish attract to its bait light that are made of bacteria,
			then its dangerous. Being said please don't pet this as a normal fish to aquarium as some maybe poisonous!</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

			<h2 class="subhead">Type of Species</h2><br>
			
			<p class="parafont">Frilled sharks are active predators and may lunge at potential prey, swallowing it whole, even if it is quite large. 
			Their normal swimming style, however, is distinctly eel-like, as they swim in a serpentine fashion. 
			The preferred prey of the frilled shark is squid, and they have several rows of long teeth, each with three long points, 
			that are perfect for snagging the soft bodies of this prey. Though they specialize on squids, frilled sharks are known to eat a variety of fishes and also other sharks. 
			<br><br><br>Frilled sharks are only very rarely encountered in the wild, so little is known about their ecology. 
			The limited information that scientists do have is based on dissection of individuals captured in deep-sea net fisheries and observation of the occasional live individual in captivity. 
			Frilled sharks reproduce via internal fertilization and give live birth. However, they do not connect to their young through a placenta, like in most mammals. 
			Instead, embryos live off of energy obtained from yolk sacs, and only after the juveniles are able to survive on their own does the mother give birth to her young.
			<br><br>Little is known about the population trends of frilled sharks, but they are rarely encountered by humans and are likely naturally rare. 
			In some places they are accidentally caught as bycatch in fisheries targeting other species, and in these cases, they may be kept and used as food. 
			No fisheries specifically target frilled sharks. Experts â€“ as a result of their natural rarity and occasional capture in some fisheries â€“ consider the frilled shark to be â€˜near threatenedâ€™ with extinction.</p><br><br><br><br>

			<p class="parafont">The frilled shark is a strange, prehistoric-looking shark that lives in the open ocean and spends much of its time in deep, 
			dark waters far below the sea surface. Its long, cylindrical body reaches lengths of nearly 7 feet (2 m), and its fins are placed far back on the body. 
			The frilled shark gets its name from the frilly appearance of its gill slits.</p><br>
			
			<h2 class="subhead">Special Interactions of this Creature</h2><br>
			
			<p class="parafont">White Frilled Shark is part of Shark family, sharks can communicate with one another visually by arching their bodies. Sharks also have the ability to feel vibrations in the water by using a special organ called the lateral line. ... 
			Sharks use this sense to find mates and to locate prey by detecting blood.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br>
